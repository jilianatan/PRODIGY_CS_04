# Simple Keylogger

## Task

This project demonstrates a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. The keylogger captures the keys pressed by the user and saves them to a file named `keylog.txt`.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes pressed by the user.
- Saves the logged keystrokes to a file named `keylog.txt`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

    git clone https://github.com/jilianatan/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd PRODIGY_CS_04
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the keylogger script:

    ```sh
    python keylogger.py
    ```

2. The script will start logging keystrokes and save them to `keylog.txt`.
